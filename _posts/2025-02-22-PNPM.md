PNPM can manage Node.js version itself.

However, there are four downsides to using PNPM as a Node version manager.

The first one is that PNPM is not a Node version manager at its core. It is a package manager that can manage the Node.js version. You can’t easily use it with other package managers like NPM or Yarn.

The second one is that Node.js installed using PNPM is not shipped with Corepack.

The third one is that PNPM can only manage the Node.js version globally. You can’t configure it per-shell.

It doesn’t switch Node.js version dynamically as you navigate from project to project. This means you have to track it all yourself and ensure it matches the version required for a project.
