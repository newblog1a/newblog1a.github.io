It has a “default” version which is global and it plays the role of fallback in case some project doesn’t have a specified Node.js version.


The other cool feature of FNM is the auto-switching of Node.js version based on the folder you’re in, but you have to do some configuration for it.

We switched between two projects, and the Node version automatically changed based on the .node-version file inside those projects.

You must install the required Node.js version on a machine to make auto-switching work properly.

The other thing to remember is that it can detect node versions only from extra files you create in a project. Those files are .node-version or .nvmrc.
