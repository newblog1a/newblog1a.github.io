## exclude

`-path` works exactly like `-name`, but applies the pattern to the entire pathname of the file being examined, instead of to the last component.

`-prune` forbids descending below the found file, in case it was a directory.

Putting it all together, the command

    find $HOME -path $HOME/$dir_name -prune -o -name "*$file_suffix" -exec cp {} $HOME/$dir_name/ \;
    

1.  Starts looking for files in `$HOME`.
2.  If it finds a file matching `$HOME/$dir_name` it won't go below it ("prunes" the subdirectory).
3.  Otherwise (`-o`) if it finds a file matching `*$file_suffix` copies it into `$HOME/$dir_name/`.

The idea seems to be make a backup of some of the contents of `$HOME` in a subdirectory of `$HOME`. The parts with `-prune` is obviously necessary in order to avoid making backups of backups...
