Screenshot an Entire Website?
This feature is now built into Google Chrome! It's still built for devs so it's a little tricky to find, but here you go:

Right click the page and open the inspector.

In the top left of Chrome Inspector you'll see a little phone icon.

Hit that and a new black bar will appear on the top of the webpage.

In the black bar you can pick the dimensions of the screen you want to stimulate (probably want 1920x1080 for a desktop monitor)

In top right of black bar is three dots, in that menu you can do a full page screenshot.
