HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) and HEIC (High Efficiency Image Coding)

HEIF is a container format designed for efficient compression, making it ideal for storing and transferring images with less data. 
HEIC, on the other hand, is essentially a variation of HEIF, specifically tailored for images encoded using the HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) codec.
While HEIF supports multiple codecs, HEIC is more narrowly focused, providing a balance of quality and efficiencyâ€”particularly for Apple ecosystems.

HEIC is unusable in many contexts due to licensing. AVIF works in the browser. But both will eventually be replaced by the superior JPEG-XL.
Also Samsung smartphones take pictures in HEIC.

AVIF is the AV1 Image File Format developed by the Alliance for Open Media in 2019 to replace WebP and compete with HEIC. It is an open and royalty-free image format which has a better compression efficiency and detail preservation that WebP, JPEG and PNG image formats.
