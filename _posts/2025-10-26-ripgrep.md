**\-u**, **\--unrestricted**

This flag reduces the level of "smart" filtering. Repeated uses (up to 3) reduces the filtering even more. When repeated three times, ripgrep will search every file in a directory tree.

A single **\-u/--unrestricted** flag is equivalent to **\--no-ignore**. Two **\-u/--unrestricted** flags is equivalent to **\--no-ignore** **\-./--hidden**. Three **\-u/--unrestricted** flags is equivalent to **\--no-ignore** **\-./--hidden** **\--binary**.

The only filtering ripgrep still does when **\-uuu** is given is to skip symbolic links and to avoid printing matches from binary files. Symbolic links can be followed via the **\-L/--follow** flag, and binary files can be treated as text files via the **\-a/--text** flag.

## Manual filtering: file types

By default, ripgrep comes with a bunch of pre-defined types. Generally, these types correspond to well known public formats. But you can define your own types as well. For example, perhaps you frequently search "web" files, which consist of JavaScript, HTML and CSS:

    $ rg --type-add 'web:*.html' --type-add 'web:*.css' --type-add 'web:*.js' -tweb title
    

or, more succinctly,

    $ rg --type-add 'web:*.{html,css,js}' -tweb title
