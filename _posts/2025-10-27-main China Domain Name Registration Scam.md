Dear Manager,


(If you are not the person who is in charge of this, please forward this to your CEO, because this is urgent. Thanks!)

This is Walker Zhou, Operating Manager of a Network Service Company which is the domain name registration center in Shanghai, China. 

On October 27, 2025, we received an application from Zhixin Holdings Ltd requested“xxxxxxxxxx” as their internet keyword and 

China (CN) domain names( xxxxxxxxxx.cn/ xxxxxxxxxx.com.cn/ xxxxxxxxxx.net.cn/ xxxxxxxxxx.org.cn). But after checking it, we find 

this name conflict with your company name or trademark. In order to deal with this matter better, it’s necessary to send email to you 

and confirm whether this company is associated with your company or not?


Kind regards


Walker
